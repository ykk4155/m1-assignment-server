						<h1>How to Adopt a Pet: Everything from A to Z</h1>
						<p>
							Each adoption center or event takes on the local flavor of its
							community and adoption partners. That means the process will be
							slightly different depending on where you go. But there are some
							common things you can expect:
						</p>
						<h4>An interview</h4>
						<p>
							Once you’ve chosen the pet who seems right for your family, you’ll
							meet with a representative from the local adoption group. They’ll
							ask you some questions to make sure that the pet is a good match
							for your home and will make you and your pet happy for many years
							to come. They may also have valuable information for you about the
							pet’s personality, medical history and habits.
						</p>
						<h4>Some paperwork</h4>
						<p>
							You will fill out an application and pay a reasonable adoption
							fee, which is usually set by the adoption partner. It’s a good
							idea to reserve 30 minutes to up to 2 hours to complete the
							interview and paperwork.
						</p>
						<h4>Welcome ! your pet home … soon.</h4>
						<p>
							In many cases, you’ll bring your pet home the same day. But there
							are some adoption partners that require a background check and/or
							home visit to ensure the pet’s long-term safety. Ask your adoption
							representative about this at the beginning of the process if
							waiting a few days is not what you had in mind. Another PetSmart
							store in your area may have a partner that does same-day
							adoptions.
